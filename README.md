# Task runner
Small utility for executing series of tasks with console reporting.


## Usage

1. Install with npm:

```
npm install @ludekarts/task-runner --save-dev

2. Create *task.js* file and import *task-runner* e.g.:

```
echo 'const { TaskRunner, runCommand } = require("@ludekarts/task-runner");' > tasks.js
```

3. Add your first tasks collection and add first task

```
const tasksCollection = {};

tasks.checkNpmVersion async function () {
  const npmVersion = await runCommand("npm -o", true);
  if (!/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+/.test(npmVersion)) {
    throw new Error("No NPM! ðŸ˜±");
  }
};

TaskRunner(tasksCollection, { showErrorReport: true });
```

4. Execute *tasks.js* script thorugh system terminal

```
> node tasks.js
```

5. Expeceted result

```
Running task: npmVersion
npmVersion: completed âœ”
No errors occured!
```

## API Reference

- **TaskRunner(** tasksCollection: Object, { selectiveList: Array (undefined), showErrorReport: Boolean(false)} **)** - Run all tasks from given *tasksCollection*. Each task is called asynchronous. If *showErrorReport* flag set to TRUE at the end user will be presented with full Error Report. By passing to *selectiveList* array of tasks to run user can specify which task should run. Best way to utilize this feature is to connect it to *precess.args* e.g.:
    ```
    const selectiveList = process.argv.slice(2);
    TaskRunner(tasks, { selectiveList, showErrorReport: true });
    ``` 
    Thank to this user can call script with names of tasks to run e.g.:

    ```
    > node tasks.js taskNameOne taskNameTwo
    ```

- **runCommand(** systemCommand: String, resolveWithData: Boolean(false) **)** -> Promise() - Allows user to run system commands. Returns promise that resolves by default with *exit code* or stringified buffer data if *resolveWithData* flag is set. If method resolves with data the output of the method will no be present in the console instead it will be returned as the promise result.

- **message** (sync methods): 
    - **info(** message: String **)** - Output blue text to the console.
    - **error(** message: String **)** - Output red text to the console.
    - **success(** message: String **)** - Output green text to the console.
    - **warning(** message: String **)** - Output orange text to the console.
    - **input(** message: String, defaultValue: String **)** -> take userInput: String -> Promise() - Display Message and take user input.
- **file** (sync methods):
    - **save (** path: String, content: String **)** - Save file under given path.
    - **read (** path: String **)** -> content: String - Read file from given path.
    - **saveJson(** path: String, json: Object **)** - Save JSON file under given path.
    - **readJson(** path: String **)** -> json: Object - Read JSON file from given path.
